# CS6316-Project

Ajay: Decision Tree, Random Forest <br />
Naeem:Logistic Regression, SVM <br />
Trent: Nearest Neighbor, Boosting <br />
Mills: NN <br />

## Execution
For the application project, our code is delivered via python notebooks:
* Neural Network: NN.ipynb
* Boosting: boosting.ipynb
* Random Forest: RandomForest6316.ipynb
* Decision Tree: DecisionTree6316.ipynb
* K Means: K_means.ipynb
* Logistic Regression: logistic.ipynb
* SVM: SVM.ipynb

### Neural Network
Our team tested and validated the Neural Network python notebook via integrated capabilities available from the PyCharm IDE.  Execution of the code is described in the Project Report.  To simulate results, execute each code block in sequential order.
### Boosting
### Random Forest 
We implimented the Random Forest Model using sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier. To simulate results, execute each code block in sequential order.
### Decision Tree
We implimented the Random Forest Model using ssklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier. To simulate results, execute each code block in sequential order.
### K Means
To simulate results, execute each code block in sequential order.
### Logistic Regression
To simulate results, execute each code block in sequential order.
### SVM
To simulate results, execute each code block in sequential order.
