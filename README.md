# CS6316-Project

Ajay: Decision Tree, Random Forest <br />
Naeem:Logistic Regression, SVM <br />
Trent: Nearest Neighbor, Boosting <br />
Mills: NN <br />

## Execution
For the application project, our code is delivered via python notebooks:
* Neural Network: NN.ipynb
* Boosting: boosting.ipynb
* Decision Tree and Random Forest: DecionTree_&_RandomForest.ipynb
* K Means: K_means.ipynb
* Logistic Regression: logistic.ipynb
* SVM: SVM.ipynb

### Neural Network
Our team tested and validated the Neural Network python notebook via integrated capabilities available from the PyCharm IDE.  Execution of the code is described in the Project Report.  To simulate results, execute each code block in sequential order.
